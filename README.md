# Project ARES

> **Live Site:** [project-ares-eight.vercel.app](https://project-ares-eight.vercel.app)

## Overview

Project ARES is an ambitious student-led initiative built for a sub-scale rocket task under the thrustMIT student project. The project focuses on developing a high-performance sounding rocket, integrating multiple subsystems—Payload, Propulsion, Avionics, and Structures—each managed by dedicated teams. The goal is to push the boundaries of aerospace engineering through innovation, research, and hands-on experimentation.

## Features

- **Modern React Web App**: Interactive, animated, and responsive UI built with React and AOS.
- **Subsystems Showcase**: Detailed sections for Payload, Propulsion, Aerodynamics, and Avionics, describing their roles and technologies.
- **Team Olympus**: Meet the diverse team behind Project ARES, with profiles and contact links.
- **Gallery**: Visual highlights of the rocket, team, and events.
- **Sponsor Wall**: Dynamic display of supporting organizations and sponsors.
- **Contact Form**: Reach out to the team directly from the website.

## Subsystems

- **Payload**: Explores stereo vision for object detection, using AI and Raspberry Pi for real-time analysis.
- **Propulsion**: Develops and tests rocket motors, characterizes propellants, and conducts static fire tests.
- **Aerodynamics**: Designs and simulates rocket components for stability and efficiency, including nosecone and fin optimization.
- **Avionics**: Builds the flight computer, processes sensor data, and implements control systems for safe and precise flight.

## Technologies Used

- React
- React Router
- AOS (Animate On Scroll)
- Custom CSS modules
